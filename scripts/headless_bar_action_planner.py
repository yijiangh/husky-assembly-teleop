"""Headless planner + slider replay for a single BarAssemblyAction movement.

Mirrors the planning + replay workflow of
``husky-assembly-teleop/scripts/headless_live_monitor_test.py`` but stays
platform-independent and has no dependency on ``husky_assembly_teleop`` or ros2.

Goal: debug how Rhino-generated ``BarAssemblyAction`` JSONs load into
compas_fab + pybullet, run planning, and confirm collision + ACM setup
are correct end-to-end.

CLI:
    python tests/headless_bar_action_planner.py [<data_root>]
        --bar-action B6.json
        --movement {M1,M2,M3,M4}
        [--gui]
        [--max-time 60]
        [--no-replay]
        [--probe-endpoints]   # M1: report start/goal feasibility, skip the RRT
        [--diagnosis]         # M4: draw birrt trees live (needs --gui); no
                              # LockRenderer, timeout-only stop
        [--load {clean,solved}]  # clean = Rhino export; solved = reuse the
                                 # half-solved sidecar and plan only the rest
        [--cell <RobotCell.json>]
